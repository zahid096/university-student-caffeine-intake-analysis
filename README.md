## 🧩 What I Did  

### ✅ Data Cleaning & Preparation  
- Removed duplicates, blanks, and inconsistent entries  
- Fixed category labels (e.g., beverage type, frequency terms)  
- Converted qualitative responses into numeric/categorical codes for easier analysis  
- Ensured proper formatting for demographic and psychological data  

### ✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Created Pivot Tables to summarize caffeine intake by demographic groups  
- Calculated mean and standard deviation of anxiety & depression scores  
- Identified correlations between caffeine intake and psychological health  
- Visualized gender-based and faculty-based consumption trends  

### ✅ Statistical Analysis  
- Performed Chi-square tests to examine relationships between:
  - Gender and caffeine intake habits  
  - Frequency of intake vs. anxiety/depression levels  
- Interpreted p-values and highlighted significant associations  

### ✅ Dashboard Development  
- Designed interactive Excel dashboard with slicers and dynamic charts to visualize:
  - Overall caffeine consumption distribution  
  - Psychological health comparison (high vs. low intake)  
  - Attitude and perception variations across demographics

## 📈 Key Insights  

- Most university students consume caffeine regularly — mainly tea and coffee.  
- Senior-year and male students tend to have higher intake frequency.  
- Significant association found between **caffeine consumption** and **anxiety levels** (*p < 0.05*).  
- Moderate caffeine users displayed more balanced mental health scores than heavy consumers.
